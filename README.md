[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

These steps are here to show the process to make a pokedex about charmander to his final evolution.

- We will start with using HTML, Scss, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, and JSON 
- Will have a shop a reading page, a list of items and a list of products page.
- ✨Magic ✨ We named our style of "manga, manhua, and manhwa" migug

## Features

- Having a purple background
- Correct information being loaded up
- Import and save files from GitHub
- Drag and drop markdown into a safe and contained place
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF


> The overriding design goal for this is to make a shop and reading page
> formatting is important because it is within my idea to make it
> as close as possible to the original. 
> The markdown is formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, formatting instructions and other things below.


## Tech Used or could be used

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery]

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub as well as itself for uploading work.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install requirements.

```sh
cd dillinger
Github accounts
The teacher that requested the project
original owner or vice owner
```

## Development

Step 1 : start laying the foundational plan for making the pokedex by checking what things would or would not be needed for it production.

step 2 : Design and creation of the web page

step 3 : then testing before the final steps are taken to ensure complete working order

step 4 : Work will be submitted and finalized before hand to make sure there will no error coming through the testing section

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
