    "Description": "In the void of the farthest reaches of space, an all powerful entity waits for a chance to alleviate the boredom of infinity that his existence brings to himself on a daily basis. Although people do gain from his boredom however dark he wishes to enact it or however rewarding and or cheerful he gives it, as his power is absolute in the void and in this void he plays the most extreme of games to stave off the boredom of time. Though sometimes he might break the wall of reality between me and you, he will always try to share his own version of fun and joy to the masses to see and view as best he can for me and you, not so far from his slice of the dimensional gap but closer to you.",
