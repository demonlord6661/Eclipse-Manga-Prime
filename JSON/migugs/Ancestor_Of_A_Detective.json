Within the land of Greece he found the key to the land of the dead that if he shed his blood upon the key that it will reach into both past and future to grant him one wish within the power of the dead, Although finding his way out of the maw of failure he was thrown into a pit of fire, one case to many for him to handle giving in he gave the mind and body to the power of the key to the land of the dead. Even so the keys chains reached into the future to find the ancestor or relative of the man who had given up to fulfill his wish with the leftover power if the key needed to be replaced, a host was more than welcome to be the next bearer of the power of the dead that had long since been vacant.",
