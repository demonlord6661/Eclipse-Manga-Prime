    "Description": "A very impulsive and energetic high school student who would always help and reach out to people who needed help and being very consistent with the help she could give, one day got an odd message on her app she had made where people could actively look for her help without judgment. On one bright evening she received a rain of messages from one person whose tag was WorldG47-A which was odd at first, but the messages sent were questions on what to do how to help what she could do to fix issues here and there and the main character answered with glee as she had someone to talk to and help every day until one night. She got a strange message from the always needing source asking if she wanted anything for her always being ready to help such a busy and struggling person day and night regardless of the time, in response she sent a message saying she only wanted to live in a world where she can go out and always help people in need of it. As such, her screen glowed brightly and strongly, blinding her for the briefest of moments what could have happened to her within that light following her response to the most mysterious of messages.",
